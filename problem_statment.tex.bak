This is the Problem Statement

Some algorithms map very well to CPUs because they are computationally light,
but what happens why your CPU cannot acheive the desired throughput or data rate?

In the past, the answer was FPGAs. But now, with Graphics Processing Units getting bigger faster stronger, there has been a recent pull towards GPUs because of

the ease of implementation vs HDL programming

the ease of setup
