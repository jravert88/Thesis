Multipath is one of the dominant causes for link loss in aeronautical telemetry.
Equalizers have been studied to combat multipath interference in aeronautical telemetry.
Blind equalizers are currently being used with SOQPSK-TG.
The Preamble Assisted Equalization (PAQ) project studied data-aided equalizers with SOQPSK-TG.
PAQ compares, side-by-side, no equalization, blind equalization, and five data-aided equalization algorithms: ZF, MMSE, MMSE-initialized CMA, and frequency domain equalization.
This thesis describes the GPU implementation of data-aided equalizer algorithms.
Static lab tests, performed with channel and noise emulators, showed that the MMSE, ZF, and FDE1 show the best and most consistent performance.
