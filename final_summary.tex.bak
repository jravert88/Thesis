\chapter{Final Summary}
\label{chap:final_summary}
Based on measured execution times of GPU kernels, multiple data-aided equalization filters where implemented for the purpose of equalizing an aeronautical telemetry channel.
Using GPU libraries and batch processing rather than custom designed GPU kernels produced massive speed ups.
Also, reformulating algorithms into frequency-domain convolution produced impressive speed ups.

\section{Data-aided Equalizer GPU Implementation Results}
For implementation in one Tesla K40c and two Tesla K20c GPUs, all the equalizers are able to execute in real-time.
It was shown that the the Frequency Domain Equalizer are the easiest to implement and have the fastest execution time.
The Constant Modulus Algorithm equalizer was shown to be the hardest to implement and has the slowest execution time.
The execution time did not provide the Constant Modulus Algorithm the opportunity to iterate many times.
The Zero Forcing and Minimum Mean Squared Error equalizers was shown to be the challenging to implement but doable and had an acceptable execution time.

\section{Final Data-aided Equalizer GPU Implementation}
Because data-aided equalizers are implemented for a real-time telemetry receiver system,
the execution time results must be considered along with the bit error rate performance.
Despite the performance of the Constant Modulus Algorithm equalizer in AWGN, the execution time per iteration does not grant the equalizer to converge in multipath.
We recommend that the Frequency Domain Equalizer One be used for the full-time telemetry system, marking the best tradeoff between performance and computational complexity.
