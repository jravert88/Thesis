Multipath is one of the dominant causes for link loss in aeronautical telemetry.
Equalizers have been studied to combat multipath interference in aeronautical telemetry.
Blind Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) equalizers are currently being used on SOQPSK-TG.
The Preamble Assisted Equalization (PAQ) has been funded by the Air Force to study data-aided equalizers on SOQPSK-TG.
PAQ compares side by side no equalization, data-aided zero forcing equalization, data-aided MMSE equalization, data-aided initialized CMA equalization, data-aided frequency domain equalization, and blind CMA equalization.
An real time experimental test setup has been assembled including an RF receiver for data acquisition, FPGA for hardware interfacing and buffering, GPUs for signal processing, spectrum analyzer for viewing multipath events, and an 8 channel bit error rate tester to compare equalization performance. 
Lab tests were done with channel and noise emulators.
Flight tests were conducted in March 2016 and June 2016 at Edwards Air Force Base to test the equalizers on live signals.
The test setup achieved a 10Mbps throughput with a 6 second delay.
This thesis studies the GPU implementation of computing and application data-aided FIR equalizer filters.
